//! A small random number generator hacked on top of Rust's standard library.
//!
//! ### Origins
//! Rust, as you may well know, has support for `HashMap`s.
//! These maps, as per their name, require hashing.
//! Hashing, of course, takes some data, and produces a random representation of that data.
//! Where we hash, random numbers follow!
//!
//! > "Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time..."
//! >
//! > â€” You explaining `attorand` to your smart contract shareholders, probably.
//!
//! ### Why `attorand`?
//! Other crates, like `rand`, can be hard to use cross-platform,
//! Because they rely on the system's source of randomness.
//! `attorand`, however, does not have this limitation,
//! and provides a firehose of random bytes to drink from.
//!
//! ### How does it work?
//! Internally, `attorand` works by repeatedly hashing a seed,
//! using the output of the last round as the input to the next.
//! The algorithm used is SipHash 1-3, as per Rust's
//! [standard library docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html),
//! but note that this is "subject to change at any point in the future".
//!
//! ### Addendum
//! Please don't use this for anything that needs cryptographic randomness.
//! (You knew that.)
//!
//! I hold no further responsibility for this abomination.
//!
//! Welp, That's it from me. What are you waiting for?
//! Allocate a fresh [`Rng`] to get started!
